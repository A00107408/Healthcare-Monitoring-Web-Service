Description:
------------

 This SBT project uses PlayEbeans to facilitate the creation of user accounts. The users data
 is then taken from my FitBit account from the FitBit Api. This is written to MongoDB collections
 and is read from there in turn and displayed using HighCharts.
 Javascript code determines is this data falls within pre-set parameters. If not, the accompanying
 Android app texts the I.C.E of potential problems.
